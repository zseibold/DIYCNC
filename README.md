## Programming and Assembly
The following resources outline some of the steps needed to program and assemble the various components needed to send GCode to the machine: 
##### GRBL
grbl is a GCode interpreter for the Aruduino IDE
https://github.com/grbl/grbl/wiki - The DIY CNC uses an older version of the grbl software as compatible hardware is less expensive and more readily available.
https://github.com/grbl/grbl/wiki/Compiling-Grbl - compiling instructions
##### DRV8825 Stepper Driver
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89BHS9hfSUk&feature=youtu.be - This online tutorial by Pololu (the manufacturer of the DRV8825 driver) details the process for setting the current limit on the DRV8825 stepper driver. 
##### CNC Shield
https://blog.protoneer.co.nz/arduino-cnc-shield-v3-00-assembly-guide/ - Protoneer designed the CNC shield used in the project. The BoM includes an inexpensive copy for cost and speed of shipment.

## Acknowledgements
The DIY CNC kit and associated documentation was created for the Fall 2020 edition of *Material Systems: Digital Design and Fabrication*, a course taught at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design by Nathan King and Zach Seibold, and TA'ed by Erin Hunt.  Burton Legeyt contributed to the design and production of the custom aluminum mounting brackets.
